Jou man chicago!

<div style="color:red"> Notice! There has been some issues with heroku and npm versions, the site might not work (if I haven't yet fixed it)</div>

I created simple but neat geography themed cv/portfolio site for me (code base from my other site opiskalija.herokuapp.com, go and check that out too!). 


The site uses mainly React and React-LeafletJS.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
